I am Theo,

My interest in cybersecurity was sparked at a young age, as I dedicated a significant amount of time to learning and exploring various aspects of the field on computers. My main areas of focus are Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) and penetration testing (Pentest), along with Operations Security and privacy. I also delve into digital forensics and reverse engineering, although I am still refining my skills in these areas. Despite not yet being an expert, I am committed to daily learning and improvement. In addition to my cybersecurity pursuits, I am a developer with proficiency in several programming languages, including Python, PHP, and Java... However, I no longer actively use PHP or Java. Instead, I primarily work with Rust for my tools, as it best aligns with my needs. While I prefer to minimize my use of Python, it remains a prevalent choice for many proof-of-concepts and tools, so I still engage with it when necessary.
